<h1>CryptoMath </h1>
 
 <h2>Few words about project</h2>
 That project is amatour crypto research and includes by default other my projects:

* Shonghe-Shtrassen multiplication
* X509decoder
* LSFSRgenerator

**_The aim of project is creating tools for implementing and testing ECC crypto ciphers_**

I've attended firstly on:

* More cheaper realisation of large integer  multiplication
* Paralleling factorisations
* Using GPU/CPU accelerations
* Jupiter NoteBook
* Library-like linkage for C/C++, python
* Cipher testing
* Both possibility to  implement as known curve params and custom
